## Process quiz data from GCP Vertex AI responses

In this project, we will build a Jupyter notebook to create a synthetic quiz dataset for using in web app.

Conventionally, quiz data could be generated from various open sources. These sources provide quizzes gathered from user's posting.
Considering this nature and be afraid of content right, I wanted to try other method of getting fake, or synthetic data.

As I'm dedicated to using cloud solutions in [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/),
I get solution from [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).
